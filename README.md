# 🏃‍♀️ Treadmill Usage - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of treadmill user data. The goal is to understand user behavior, identify trends, and generate insights that can help improve fitness services and user engagement.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This notebook explores a dataset containing treadmill usage information, user demographics, and fitness parameters. Key questions answered include:

- What is the age distribution of treadmill users?
- How does usage vary by gender?
- Are there patterns in calories burned across different age groups?
- What is the relationship between heart rate, duration, and performance?

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Most users are in the age range of XX–XX.
- Gender distribution is roughly X% male and X% female.
- Longer treadmill sessions are strongly correlated with higher calorie burn.
- Peak heart rate tends to be higher in younger users.
